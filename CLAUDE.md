# Poverty Point Costly Signaling Project

## Project Overview

This project applies the costly signaling/bet-hedging framework developed for Rapa Nui and Chaco Canyon to Poverty Point (ca. 1700-1100 BCE), a Late Archaic hunter-gatherer site in northeastern Louisiana. The central puzzle: why would mobile hunter-gatherers invest massively in monumental earthwork construction and long-distance exotic goods acquisition?

## Theoretical Framework

### Core Hypothesis
Poverty Point represents an adaptive costly signaling system where:
1. Environmental/resource uncertainty created conditions favoring cooperation
2. Seasonal aggregation provided opportunities for signaling and collaboration
3. Monumental construction served as a costly signal of group commitment/capacity
4. Exotic goods functioned as individual-level signals within the aggregation system
5. The signaling system facilitated inter-group cooperation and reduced conflict

### Key Differences from Previous Cases

| Feature | Rapa Nui | Chaco Canyon | Poverty Point |
|---------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Subsistence | Agriculture | Agriculture | Hunter-gatherer |
| Settlement | Permanent | Semi-permanent | Seasonal aggregation |
| Social org | Territorial kin groups | Corporate great houses | Fluid band networks |
| Time depth | ~500 years | ~300 years | ~600 years |
| Signal type | Moai/ahu | Great houses + exotics | Mounds + exotics |
| Geography | Isolated island | Regional network | River confluence hub |

### Adaptation Required
The model must account for:
- **Seasonal aggregation dynamics**: Population fluctuates between dispersed bands and large gatherings
- **Fission-fusion social structure**: Groups form and dissolve flexibly
- **Hunter-gatherer resource uncertainty**: Different risk structure than agricultural systems
- **Collaboration benefits**: Returns to scale from communal activities (fishing, construction, exchange)
- **Ecotone positioning**: Site location at intersection of multiple ecological zones

### Ecological Diversity Hypothesis

**Key insight**: Poverty Point's location may not be coincidental - it sits at the intersection of multiple ecotones:
- Mississippi River floodplain (aquatic resources, seasonal flooding)
- Macon Ridge uplands (terrestrial game, nut-bearing forests)
- Bayou Macon drainage (fish, shellfish, waterfowl)
- Prairie/forest edge to the west

This positioning could:
1. **Maximize resource stability**: When one zone fails, others may compensate
2. **Reduce aggregation risk**: Gatherings can exploit multiple resource types
3. **Explain site primacy**: Other locations lack this ecotone diversity
4. **Create natural gathering point**: Central access to diverse procurement zones

The model should incorporate:
- Multiple resource patch types (aquatic, terrestrial, wetland)
- Differential covariance between patch types (negative = buffering)
- Location-dependent access to ecotone diversity

## Archaeological Context

### Poverty Point Site (16WC5)
- Location: Macon Ridge, northeastern Louisiana (32.63°N, 91.41°W)
- Dates: ca. 1700-1100 BCE (Late Archaic)
- Size: ~160 hectares of constructed landscape
- Features:
  - 6 concentric C-shaped ridges (~22m wide, 1-2m high)
  - Mound A (Bird Mound): 22m high, largest Pre-Columbian mound north of Mexico at time
  - Mound B: 6.4m high conical mound
  - Multiple smaller mounds
  - Central plaza (~17 hectares)

### Labor Investment Estimates
- Ridge construction: ~750,000 cubic meters of earth moved
- Mound A alone: ~238,000 cubic meters
- Conservative estimates: 1-5 million person-hours of labor
- Construction episodes appear rapid, not gradual accumulation

### Exotic Materials at Poverty Point
Long-distance exchange network spanning 1,600+ km:
- **Copper**: Great Lakes region (~1,600 km)
- **Galena (lead ore)**: Missouri/Illinois (~800 km)
- **Steatite (soapstone)**: Appalachian region (~900 km)
- **Novaculite**: Ouachita Mountains (~250 km)
- **Hematite**: Various sources
- **Crystal quartz**: Arkansas (~300 km)

### Regional Context
Other Poverty Point-period sites exist but are much smaller:
- Jaketown (Mississippi): ~10 hectares, 1 small mound
- Claiborne (Mississippi coast): Shell ring site
- J.W. Copes (Louisiana): Small mound complex
- Numerous small camps and extraction sites

**Key pattern**: Poverty Point is orders of magnitude larger than contemporary sites, suggesting it served a unique regional function.

## Research Questions

### Q1: Why Aggregation?
What conditions made seasonal aggregation at this location adaptive for otherwise mobile hunter-gatherers?
- Resource concentration (fish runs, nut harvests)?
- Information exchange benefits?
- Mating network maintenance?
- Risk pooling across diverse resource zones?

### Q2: Why Monumental Construction?
Why invest in permanent architecture when mobility is the norm?
- Signal of commitment to the aggregation system?
- Coordination mechanism for collective action?
- Territorial marker reducing conflict?
- "Sunk cost" creating return incentives?

### Q3: Why This Location?
What made the Macon Ridge location the regional center rather than elsewhere?
- Bayou Macon/Mississippi River confluence ecology?
- Central position in exchange network?
- Historical contingency (first-mover advantage)?

### Q4: Why Collapse?
Poverty Point was largely abandoned by 1100 BCE. Why?
- Climate shift (Medieval Climate Anomaly precursors)?
- Social system instability?
- Declining returns to aggregation?

## Model Design

### Agent Types
1. **Bands**: Small mobile groups (15-30 individuals) that:
   - Forage across home ranges
   - Decide whether to aggregate seasonally
   - Invest in monuments during aggregation
   - Acquire/exchange exotic goods

2. **Aggregation sites**: Locations where bands gather, including:
   - Poverty Point (major hub)
   - Secondary sites (smaller aggregations)

### Key Mechanisms

#### Aggregation Decision
Bands decide to aggregate based on:
- Expected resource availability at aggregation site
- Expected benefits from cooperation (information, exchange, mating)
- Costs of travel and time away from foraging
- Signal value of participation

#### Monument Investment
During aggregation, bands contribute labor to construction:
- Contribution is costly (time/energy diverted from foraging)
- Contributions are visible to other bands (honest signal)
- Cumulative investment creates shared infrastructure

#### Exotic Goods
Individuals acquire and display exotic materials:
- Acquisition costs vary by distance to source
- Display provides status within aggregation
- Exchange creates inter-band obligations

#### Cooperation Benefits
Aggregation enables:
- Fish weir construction and communal fishing
- Information sharing about resource patches
- Mating opportunities maintaining genetic diversity
- Risk pooling through reciprocal obligations

### Environmental Uncertainty (σ)
For hunter-gatherers, σ derives from:
- Seasonal resource variability
- Inter-annual fluctuations in key resources
- Spatial patchiness requiring mobility
- Unpredictable events (floods, droughts, prey movements)

### Critical Threshold (σ*)
Aggregation-based signaling becomes adaptive when:
- Resource uncertainty is high enough that cooperation pays
- But not so extreme that aggregation is impossible
- Travel costs don't exceed cooperation benefits

## Notes

This project is separate from but parallel to:
- `/Users/clipo/PycharmProjects/costly-signaling-abm` (Rapa Nui)
- `/Users/clipo/PycharmProjects/chaco-signaling` (Chaco Canyon)

The theoretical framework is shared, but the model mechanics differ significantly due to hunter-gatherer aggregation dynamics.

# Poverty Point Costly Signaling Model

Applying the costly signaling framework to explain hunter-gatherer monumentality at Poverty Point, Louisiana (ca. 1700-1100 BCE).

## The Puzzle

Poverty Point represents one of the most extraordinary archaeological sites in North America:
- **Massive earthworks**: 6 concentric ridges + multiple mounds including the largest pre-Columbian mound north of Mexico at its time
- **Hunter-gatherer builders**: No agriculture, no permanent villages - mobile foragers
- **Extensive exchange**: Exotic materials from 1,600+ km away (copper, galena, steatite)
- **Rapid construction**: Evidence suggests intensive construction episodes, not gradual accumulation

Traditional models struggle to explain why mobile hunter-gatherers would invest so heavily in permanent architecture and long-distance exchange.

## The Hypothesis

We propose that Poverty Point functioned as an adaptive costly signaling system:

1. **Resource uncertainty** created conditions favoring inter-group cooperation
2. **Seasonal aggregation** at the site provided opportunities for signaling and collaboration
3. **Monumental construction** served as a costly signal of group commitment
4. **Exotic goods** functioned as individual-level signals within the aggregation system
5. The system reduced conflict and facilitated cooperation among otherwise competing bands

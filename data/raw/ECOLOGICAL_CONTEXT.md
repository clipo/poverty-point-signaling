# Ecological Context for Poverty Point

## Site Location and Ecotone Position

Poverty Point is located on Macon Ridge, overlooking the west side of the Mississippi River floodplain, approximately 15.5 miles from the current river channel.

### Strategic Ecotone Positioning

The site sits at the intersection of multiple ecological zones:

1. **Macon Ridge Uplands** (elevated terrace)
   - Hardwood forests (oak, hickory, pecan)
   - Grassland habitats
   - Safe from seasonal flooding
   - Stayed dry even during 1927 Mississippi flood

2. **Mississippi River Floodplain** (to the east)
   - Seasonal flooding created swampy habitat
   - Fish, waterfowl, turtles, frogs
   - Aquatic plants (lotus, cattail)

3. **Bayou Macon Drainage** (adjacent)
   - Bottomland hardwood riparian forest
   - Year-round aquatic resources
   - Connection to broader river systems

4. **Prairie/Forest Edge** (to the west)
   - Transitional habitat
   - Diverse game populations

### Resource Diversity

**From floodplain/aquatic zones:**
- Fish (>70% of identifiable food bone at some sites)
- Waterfowl (ducks, geese)
- Turtles, frogs
- Aquatic plants (lotus, cattail tubers)

**From upland/ridge zones:**
- Deer (primary large game)
- Small mammals (rabbits, raccoons, squirrels, opossums)
- Wild turkey
- Nuts (pecans, black walnuts, hickory)
- Fruits (persimmons, pawpaws, muscadine grapes, hackberries)
- Seeds and herbs

**Non-local resources (required trade):**
- Stone (nearest sources 25-30 miles)
- High-quality lithics from hundreds of miles

## Subsistence Pattern

### Diet Composition

Based on archaeological evidence:

| Resource | Contribution | Seasonality |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Fish | >70% of protein | Year-round, peak spring/summer |
| Deer | Primary land meat | Fall/winter |
| Nuts | Carbohydrates, oil | Fall harvest, stored |
| Waterfowl | Supplementary meat | Fall/winter migrations |
| Small game | Supplementary | Year-round |
| Plant foods | Carbohydrates | Seasonal peaks |

### Seasonal Round

1. **Spring/Summer**: Focus on fishing, aquatic resources
   - Fish runs in rivers/bayous
   - Spawning concentrations
   - Peak aquatic productivity

2. **Fall**: Nut harvest, deer hunting
   - Mast crops (pecans, hickory, acorns)
   - Deer fat accumulation for winter
   - Waterfowl migrations begin

3. **Winter**: Hunting emphasis
   - Deer hunting continues
   - Waterfowl
   - Stored nuts and dried fish

4. **Late Winter/Early Spring**: Lean season
   - Depleted stores
   - Fish begin activity
   - Early plant greens

### Aggregation Hypothesis

The ecotone position enabled aggregation by:

1. **Reducing aggregation risk**: Multiple resource zones meant that if one zone had a poor year, others could compensate

2. **Extended residence feasibility**: Unlike single-zone locations, the ecotone provided year-round resources sufficient for larger populations

3. **Central access**: The site provided equidistant access to diverse procurement zones

4. **Surplus generation**: The productivity of the ecotone may have generated surplus sufficient to support construction labor

## Comparison to Other Locations

Why Poverty Point rather than elsewhere?

**Macon Ridge advantages:**
- Flood-safe elevation
- Adjacent to (not in) floodplain
- Multiple ecotone access
- River system connections for trade

**Other regional sites:**
- Jaketown (MS): Similar river position but different resource mix
- Claiborne (MS coast): Coastal resources but limited upland access
- Smaller sites: Typically single-zone focused

## Implications for Model

### Resource Patch Types

The model should include distinct patch types with different:
- Base productivity levels
- Seasonal variation patterns
- Covariance structure (negative covariance = buffering)

```
Patch types:
1. Aquatic (fish, waterfowl) - high spring/summer, variable
2. Terrestrial (deer, small game) - more stable, peak fall/winter
3. Mast (nuts) - highly variable year-to-year, fall only
4. Mixed/ecotone - access to multiple types, more stable overall
```

### Location Value Calculation

Site value should depend on:
- Number of accessible patch types
- Distance to each patch type
- Covariance between patch productivities
- Total expected productivity across seasons

### Aggregation Site Selection

The model could:
1. Allow multiple potential aggregation locations
2. Let bands "vote with their feet" about where to aggregate
3. Emergent primacy of ecotone locations

## Data Needs

### To compile from literature:
1. Fish species and seasonal availability patterns
2. Deer population dynamics and hunting returns
3. Mast crop variability (year-to-year nut production)
4. Modern analogs for productivity estimates

### Potential proxy data:
1. Modern fisheries data for Lower Mississippi
2. Mast survey data from Louisiana/Mississippi
3. Deer harvest records as productivity proxy

Poverty Point Costly Signaling Simulation

This package implements an agent-based model of hunter-gatherer aggregation
and costly signaling at Poverty Point, Louisiana (ca. 1700-1100 BCE).

Key components:
- simulation: Core simulation engine with aggregation dynamics
- bands: Band agent behavior and decision-making
- environment: Resource patches and seasonal cycles
- aggregation: Aggregation site dynamics and cooperation benefits
- analysis: Statistical analysis and visualization

The model explores whether monumental construction and exotic goods
exchange can be explained as adaptive costly signaling that facilitated
cooperation among otherwise mobile hunter-gatherer bands.
